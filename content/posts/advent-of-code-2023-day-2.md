## Data Structures

Every `game` has an `id` and many `[]` (sub)`sets`


(sub)`sets` is just a map of `color` to `count`

> **Why not struct with colors as keys**

Will have to handle each color

Don't know if there are more colors in bag


---

## Parsing

```
Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
```

For each line:
1. Scan `Id`
2. Split by `:`, discard first half
3. Split by `;`, we get subsets
	1. Create map
	2. Split by `,` we get colors and counts
	3. Trim space
	4. Scan `color`, `count`
	5. Update our map

## Part 1

Check all subsets of each game

If each subset is valid, select game
Subsets are totally independent


***gist*** : Just loop

### <ins>Approach 1</ins>

> **Flag to see if game is valid**

Correct

Don't want to deal with flag üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### <ins>Approach 2</ins>

> **Select game, deselect if not valid**

Correct

Got to use loop labels


---

## Part 2

Check all subsets of each game

Keep track of max for each game


***gist*** : Just loop

Can reuse earlier declared data structure
