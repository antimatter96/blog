Part 1 : Style","keywords":["pop"],"articleBody":" I recently read the book The Practice of Programming\nBasic Principles of Good Software Simplicity : keeping programs short and manageable Clarity : making sure they are easy to understand, for people as well as machines Generality : they work well in a broad range of situations and adapt well as new situations arise Style Purpose of Style Make the code easy to read for yourself and others\nRules Regarding\nNaming A variable or a function name labels an object, conveys information about its purpose.\nWhy Bother?\nNaming conventions make it easier to understand your own code as well as code written by others. They also make it easier to invent new names as the code is being written The longer the program, the more important is the choice of good. descriptive, systematic names\ntl;dr:\ninformative Concise memorable, and pronounceable The broader the scope of a variable, the more information should be conveyed by its name.\nSince Global variables can crop up anywhere in a program, they need names long enough and descriptive enough to remind the reader of their meaning. Use descriptive names for globals, short names for locals.\nBe consistent Give related things related names that show their relationship and highlight their difference. Eg in a class\nUse active names for functions Function names should be based on active verbs, perhaps followed by nouns: Functions that return a boolean (true or false) value should be named so that the return value is unambiguous (check vs is)\nBe accurate. It conveys information to the reader. A misleading name can result in mystifying bugs At the time the code is written, this might not cause trouble, but if the program is modified later, perhaps by a different programmer, the name is sure to confuse.\nConsistent adherence to a sensible convention.\nExpressions and Statements Write the clearest code that does the job\nIndent to show structure\nUse the natural form for expressions\nConditional expressions that include negations are always hard to understand\nParenthesize to resolve ambiguity\nGrouping the operands of higher-precedence operators helps the reader to see the structure more quickly.\nBreak up complex expressions.\nBe clear. Programmers’ endless creative energy is sometimes used to write the most concise code possible, or to find clever ways to achieve a result. Sometimes these skills are misapplied, though, since the goal is to write clear code, not clever code.\nThe ? : operator is fine for short expressions where it can replace four lines of if-else\nClarity is not the same as brevity. Often the clearer code will be shorter, but it can also be longer\nThe proper criterion is ease of understanding.\nBe careful with side effects.\nConsistency and Idioms Consistency leads to better programs.\nAny variation suggests a genuine difference, one worth noting.\nUse a consistent indentation and brace style\nspecific style is much less important than its consistent application. Pick one style, preferably ours, use it consistently, and don’t waste time arguing.\nIf you work on a program you didn’t write, preserve the style you find there. When you make a change, don’t use your own style even though you prefer it. The program’s consistency is more important than your own, because it makes life easier for those who follow.\nUse idioms for consistency\nBraces Indentation should be idiomatic, too. iteration\nSprawling layouts also force code onto multiple screens or pages, and thus detract from readability.\nUse else-ifs for multi-way decisions.\nTrailing else parts may be omitted if there is no action for the default, although leaving it in with an error message may help to catch conditions that “can’t happen.”\nAttempts to re-use pieces of code often lead to tightly knotted programs:\nCases should almost always end with a break, with the rare exceptions commented\nThe increase in size is more than offset by the increase in clarity\nFunction Macros -» Can have side-effectss\nMagic Numbers Magic numbers are the constants, array sizes, character positions, conversion factors, and other literal numeric values that appear in programs.\nGive names to magic numbers A raw number in program source gives no indication of its importance or derivation, making the program harder to understand and modify\nBy giving names to the principal numbers in any calculation, we can make the code easier to follow, and change\nUse character constants, not integers** Comments Comments are meant to help the reader of a program. They do not help by saying things the code already plainly says, or by contradicting the code, or by distracting the reader with elaborate typographical displays. The best comments aid the understanding of a program by briefly pointing out salient details or by providing a lager-scale view of the proceedings.\nDon’t belabor the obvious\nComments should add something that is not immediately evident from the code, or collect into one place information that is spread through the source.\nComment functions and global data.\nDon’t comment bad code, rewrite it. Comment anything unusual or potentially confusing, but when the comment outweighs the code, the code probably needs fixing.\nDon’t contradict the code When you change code, make sure the comments are still accurate comment should say so, and the code should do so\nClarify, don’t confuse. Comments are supposed to help readers over the hard parts, not create more obstacles.\nSometimes code is genuinely difficult, perhaps because the algorithm is complicated or the data structures are intricate. In that case, a comment that points to a source of understanding can aid the reader. It may also be valuable to suggest why particular decisions were made\nWell-written code is easier to read and to understand, almost surely has fewer errors, and is likely to be smaller than code that has been carelessly tossed together and never polished.\nIn the rush to get programs out the door to meet some deadline, it’s easy to push style aside, to worry about it later. Sloppy code is bad code-not just awkward and hard to read, but often broken.\nThe key observation is that good style should be a matter of habit. If you think about style as you write code originally, and if you take the time to revise and improve it, you will develop good habits.\nOnce they become automatic, your subconscious will take care of many of the details for you, and even the code you produce under pressure will be better.\n","wordCount":"1059","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-07-01T03:11:33+05:30","dateModified":"2020-07-01T03:11:33+05:30","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://arpit.space/blog/posts/the-practice-of-programming-1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Arpit Jain's blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://arpit.space/blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://arpit.space/blog/ accesskey=h title="AJ (Alt + H)">AJ</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://arpit.space/ title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://arpit.space/blog/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://arpit.space/blog/search/ title="Search 🔎"><span>Search 🔎</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>The Practice Of Programming : Part 1 - Style</h1><div class=post-description>Summary of The Practice Of Programming.
